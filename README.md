# Blog API

A full-stack RESTful blog API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.  
It includes two React front-end applications, one for the CMS (Content Management System) and one for the client-facing side.  
The back-end is built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

### Features
- Users can create, read, update and delete posts through CMS and client front-end
- Users can register and log in to the CMS
- Users can upload images and videos
- Users can search for posts by keywords
- Users can filter posts by categories

#### Goals
- Create a fully functional blog API with CRUD functionality
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Create a user-friendly CMS for managing the blog posts
- To provide a client-facing side for users to view and read the blog posts

#### Challenges Faced
- Managing the state of the application in a way that allows for easy updates and deletion of posts
- Ensuring that the API is secure and protected against malicious attacks
- Implementing user authentication and authorization was challenging due to the complexity of the processes and the need to ensure the security of the data.
- Creating a CMS that is easy to use for non-technical users was a challenge as I had to ensure that the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

## API Endpoints
The API has the following endpoints:
- `GET /posts`: Retrieve all posts
- `GET /posts/:id`: Retrieve a specific post by ID
- `POST /posts`: Create a new post
- `PUT /posts/:id`: Update a specific post by ID
- `DELETE /posts/:id`: Delete a specific post by ID

## Local Installation
1.	Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Waldorfio/blog-client.git`
2.	Install the dependencies `npm install`
3.	Start the web server using `npm run dev`
4.	Open the CMS in your browser at `http://localhost:3001` and Client at `http://localhost:3000`

## Technologies Used
- React with TypesScript for the front-end
- Node.js and Express.js for the back-end
- MongoDB for the database
- Webpack for building and bundling the application
